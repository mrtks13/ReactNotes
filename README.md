15 React Best Practices You Need to Follow in 2020
https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/react-best-practices/


Best Practices List
[Update May 22nd, 2019] — When using ReduxJS, split your Reducer code into smaller methods to avoid huge JSON within your Reducer.
Consider using TypeScript in your apps if you do not do it already.
Use the create-react-app generator to bootstrap your ReactJS app.
Keep your code DRY. Don’t Repeat Yourself, but keep in mind code duplicate is NOT always a bad thing.
Avoid having large classes, methods or components, including Reducers.
Use more robust managers to manage application state, such as Redux.
Use event synchronizer, such as Redux-Thunk, for interactions with your back end API.
Avoid passing too many attributes or arguments. Limit yourself to five props that you pass into your component.
Use ReactJS defaultProps and ReactJS propTypes.
Use linter, break up lines that are too long.
Keep your own jslint configuration file.
Always use a dependency manager with a lock file, such as NPM or yarn.
Test your commonly accessed code, code that is complex and prone to bugs.
Write more tests that give more test coverage for your code with a little effort and test code to ensure its proper functioning.
Every time you find a bug, make sure you write a test first.
Use function-based components by starting to use React Hooks, a new ReactJS way to create state-full components.
Use ES6 de-structuring for your props.
Use conditional rendering.
User `map()` to collect and render collections of components.
Use partial components, such as `<>` … `</>`
Name your event handlers with handle prefixes, such as `handleClick()` or `handleUpdate()`.
Use `onChange` to control your inputs, such as `onChange={this.handleInputChange}`.
Use JEST to test your ReactJS code.
